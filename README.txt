In order to test the Sencha Touch application, there are two options. 

To test the live application, access the website share.magpie.net/~alena/Mobile from a mobile browser running on an iOS device (an iPhone or an iPod Touch). 
It is also possible to see the code inside the dist folder on this CD.


To access the unminified version, open the app folder and subsequently the index.html file in a Chrome browser.


To run the application from a local computer simply open the app\index.html file in a Chrome browser.
